A simple, yet üí™, _slightly opiniated_ database framework for Fauna, written in Javascript (Typescript).

> üôÉ You're on beta release. Don't get scared though, the api is pretty stable but tests need to be added to be fool-proof. (Thus, as of yet, Biota isn't production ready.)

> ‚ù§Ô∏è [Check the features](https://biota.canny.io/features) and [request the ones](https://biota.canny.io/features) you would love to see in **biota**. (They arn't all listed yet!)

```js
import { Biota } from "biota";
```

```js
// 4 lines to:
const db = new Biota({ secret: "<your-secret>", private_key: "123" });

// - scaffold the whole database (inc. users collection for ex)
await db.foundation();

// - add todos collection
await db.collection("todos").scaffold();

// - add autocomplete-search on name field
await db.collection("todos").index({ field: "name", ngram: true });
```

```js
// 4 lines to:
// - create a user & login
let asUser = await db.user.register("my@email.com", "password", {
  nickname: "Georgy",
});

// - create a todo
await asUser.collection("todos").insert({ name: "Remember to star this project" });

// - query a todo with $ngram (autocomplete behavior)
await asUser.collection("todos").find({ name: { $ngram: "star" } });
// output: [{ ref, ts, data: { name: "Remember to star this project" } }]
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will take you through the few steps to get started playing with your [Fauna](fauna.com/) database.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to add `biota` either as a global or local (project) dependency.

```js
yarn add biota // -G for global
// or
npm i biota // -G for global
```

### Import

```js
import { Biota } from "biota";
// or
const { Biota } = require("biota");
```

### Instance

There are **two ways** to instantiate Biota.

1. You can use a `admin/server key` (or any secret key) as a paremeter.

```js
const db = new Biota({ secret: "<your-secret>"})
// example
await db.query( q.Create(...) )
```

2. You can use the function `.user.login(id, password)` to log a user.

```js
const db = new Biota()
const logged = await db.user.login("123", "super_password123")
// example
await logged.query( q.Create(...) )
```

### Api

Even though you can `query` your database (same as you would do with the same fauna method `query`), the main power of **Biota** lives in its [extended api](#).

> ‚è≥ **Patience**: It's coming.. :)

### Helpers

```js
const { q, factory, Page } = require('biota')
// q: export the query builder, same as fauna.query
q.If(..., true, false)
// factory: export the factory api (helpers that wrap FQL)
factory.create.database(name, options)
```

## Running the tests

If you want to run the tests, you'll need to provide a `FAUNA_KEY_TEST=<your-test-key>` in a `.env` file.
