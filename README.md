A simple *opiniated* database framework for Fauna, written in Javascript/Typescript.
**Includes:** role/rules system, documents tracking, auto-indexing, complex search (inc. autocomplete), build-in action history, relations 

```js
// 10 lines to set up your database, create a user, create a todo and fuzzy search it ;)
import { Biota } from "biota"

const db = new Biota({ secret: "<your-secret>"}) // instantiates

await db.foundation() // scaffolds the database, make sure the minimum is set

await db.collection("todos").scaffold() // scaffolds a todos collection

await db.collection("todos").index({field: "name", ngram: true}) // index a field for autocomplete search

let { ref } = await db.collection("users").insert({ nickname: "gahabeen" }, { password: "youdontknowme" }) // adds a user

const logged = await db.login(ref.id, "youdontknowme") // logs in as the user

// you can know query as the user
const todos = logged.collection("todos")

await todos.insert({ name: "Remember to star this project" })

await todos.find({ name: { $ngram: "star" }})
// output: [{ ref, ts, data: { name: "Remember to star this project" } }]
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will take you through the few steps to get started playing with your [Fauna](fauna.com/) database.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to add `biota` either as a global or local (project) dependency.

```js
yarn add biota // -G for global
// or
npm i biota // -G for global
```
### Import
```js
import { Biota } from "biota"
// or
const { Biota } = require("biota")
```

### Instance

There are **two ways** to instantiate Biota.

1. You can use a `admin/server key` (or any secret key) as a paremeter.  
```js
const db = new Biota({ secret: "<your-secret>"})
// example
await db.query( fqlQuery )
```

2. You can use the function `.login(id, password)` to log a user.  
```js
const db = new Biota()
const logged = await db.login("123", "super_password123")
// example
await logged.query( fqlQuery )
```
### Api
Even though you can `query` your database (same as you would do with the same fauna method `query`), the main power of **Biota** lives in its [extended api](#).

### Helpers

```js
const { q, factory } = require('biota')
// q: export the query builder, same as fauna.query
// factory: export the factory api (helpers that wrap FQL)
```

## Running the tests

If you want to run the tests, you'll need to provide a `FAUNA_KEY_TEST=<your-test-key>` in a `.env` file.
